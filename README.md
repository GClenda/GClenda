### Hi there 👋

I'm Glenda, a Full Stack Software Engineer with a relentless passion for continuous learning and self-improvement.

🚀 My mission is to become a better developer each day. I'm deeply committed to mastering the world of software development and am always eager to explore new technologies and build innovative projects. As I continue to grow in this exciting field, I find joy in tackling complex challenges and turning ideas into reality.

💡 Currently, I'm focused on refining and enhancing my existing skills, ensuring that I’m well-versed in the latest technologies and best practices. I believe that the best way to learn is by doing, so you’ll often find me engaged in coding challenges and seeking out opportunities to deepen my expertise.

🤝 Collaboration is at the heart of what I do. I'm open to connecting with experienced developers for mentorship or teaming up on projects that push the boundaries of what I know. If you have advice to share or a project idea in mind, I’d love to connect and create something amazing together.

🌱 Beyond code, I value quality time with my family and friends. Living in the beautiful Seattle area, I also enjoy hiking and exploring the great outdoors.
