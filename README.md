### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm Glenda, a Full Stack Software Engineer on a journey of continuous learning and self-improvement.

ðŸš€ My goal is to become a better developer each day. I'm passionate about mastering the world of software development. As a beginner in this exciting field, I'm enthusiastic about exploring new technologies, and building projects.

Currently, I'm learning Java. I'm open to collaboration and mentorship from any experienced developers. If you have any advice or want to work on a project together, I'd love to connect.

ðŸ’¡ I believe that the best way to learn is by doing, so you'll often find me tackling coding challenges, and seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills.

Outside of coding, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends. I live in the Seattle area so love doing hikes.
