### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
I'm Glenda, an entry-level software engineer on a journey of continuous learning an self-impovenment.

ğŸš€ My goal is to become a better developer each day. I'm passionate about mastering the world od software development. As a beginner in this exiting field, I'm enthusiastic about exploring new technologies, and building projects.

Currently I'm learning Java. I'm open to collaboration and mentorship from any experienced developers. If you have any advice or want to work on a project together, I'd loce to connect.

ğŸ’¡ I believe that the best way to learn is by doing, so you'll often find me tackling coding challenges, and seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills.

Outside if coding, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends. I live in the seattle area so love doing hikes.
